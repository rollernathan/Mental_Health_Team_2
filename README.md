# Project Overview

Mental health is an important part of one's overall well being. It is as important as physical health. Many factors can contribute to one's mental health. Going to work is a common activity in many adult lives, which can significantly impact one's mental health. Within a workplace, there are multiple factors that can impact mental health, such as remote work setups, ease of taking leave, mental health programs, etc.

A 2014 survey assess attitudes toward mental health and the frequency of mental health disorders in the workplace. The findings from this survery were analyzed to extract conclusions about what factors can affect mental health treatment seeking behavior.

## Questions to Answer

1. Does remote vs. onsite work affect mental health in the workplace?
2. How does mental health impact work performance?
3. Is there a relationship between the level of difficulty of taking leave and mental health outcomes? 
4. What is the impact of company size on mental health?
5. Are mental health programs implemented by companies effective?
6. Is the number of people seeking treatment randomly distributed?
7. Is there a relationship between age and seeking treatment?
8. Are there differences in mental health treatment seeking behavior between self employed and employed individuals?
9. Is there a relationship between the family history of mental health and the behavior of those seeking mental health treatment?

## Important things to consider

- The dataset was filtered by participants who live in the United States
- For the "self-employed" category, NA values were converted into "No" for ease of analysis


1. Relationship between remote work and mental health in the workplace

![Remote work in the workplace](https://github.com/rollernathan/Mental_Health_Team_2/blob/main/nthapliyal/Figures/remote_status_vs_treatment.png)

The percentage of participants who seek mental health treatment are approximately equal between those who work remotely and those who do not. This suggests that working remotely is not a major factor that affects people mental health treatment or not.

2. Impact of mental health on work performance

! [Impact of mental health on work performance] (https://github.com/rollernathan/Mental_Health_Team_2/blob/main/nthapliyal/Figures/work_interference_vs_treatment.png)

Of those who do not seek mental health treatment, a majority of participants (approximately 50%) report that their mental health does not interfere with their work. This may be due to either being in good mental health or lack of awareness of how mental health can affect performance at work. Of those who do seek mental health treatment, a majority of participants (approximately 55%) report that their mental health sometimes interferes with their work. This may be explained by the fact that seeking mental health treatment may increase awareness of work can be affected by mental health issues. The next largest groups (each at approximately 20%) each report that their mental health either rarely or often interferes with work. For those who report their mental health rarely affects their work performance, this may be due to the fact that seeking treatment is effective in alleviating work interference. And for those who report that their mental health often interferes with work, that may be the reason in itself for one to seek treatment.
