Question: 
Does the difficulty/ease of taking mental health leave from work affect whether or not employees seek treatment?

![Ease of Taking Leave](https://github.com/rollernathan/Mental_Health_Team_2/blob/main/Project%201_images/P1_Graph_EaseOfLeave.png)

Summary: 
A review of the dataset shows a correlation between the ease of taking mental health leave and whether or not a person gets treatment. As shown in the bar chart, the majority of employees are unsure what their company's mental health leave policy entails. This could be for a variety of reasons, including a lack of need/interest on the part of the employee, or a lack of communication from management. The latter implies that mental health is not at the forefront of the organization, while the former could happen for a variety of reasons. Of the respondents, the ones who answered "Don't Know" are the only group that had less employees taking leave than not.

When considering the difference between the “somewhat easy/difficult” and “very easy/difficult”, we have to consider the subjective nature of the wording. What some people consider "very" difficult, others may consider only "somewhat" difficult. For that reason, it makes sense to review this dataset by looking at “somewhat” and “very” difficult or easy together, which shows that people are much more likely to take leave when the company policy is easy versus when it is difficult. 

Limitations of this dataset:
To understand the reasons people do or do not take leave, we would need to look more deeply into where they live, what their family situation was like and what their position in the company might be. For example, are higher level employees more or less likely to take leave? What role does income play? Does the company offer insurance that covers mental healthcare or do they just have a leave policy? 

Though many of the datapoints are still relative today, mental health is a rapidly evolving field, but remains relatively new in terms of being something that is dealt with in the workplace. In recent years, particularly since the pandemic, work situations have changed dramatically, so some of the responses in this dataset could be outdated. For example, many more people work from home or have a hybrid arrangement than they did in 2014 when this was conducted. It is also true that more companies than ever have implemented mental health policies since 2014. 

Question:
Does company size impact whether or not an employee seeks mental health treatment? 

![Company Size and Mental Health Treatment](https://github.com/rollernathan/Mental_Health_Team_2/blob/main/Project%201_images/P1_Graph_Company_Size.png)

Summary:
Employees are willing to seek mental health treatment regardless of the size of the company, with the exception of companies that have 1000+ employees, which had an even number people who answered "yes" and "no" to seeking mental health treatment.

People working for smaller companies had more willingness to seek treatment, which could be for a variety of reasons, such as the means of communication and closeness of the relationships between the employer and staff.

In addition to the graph, the boxplot shows that more employees sought treatment overall than those who did not.

Limitations:
Companies with 500-1000 employees are underrepresented in this dataset. Despite the underrepresentation, however, the results follow the same trend as the other populations.

Additionally, the data does not offer much information about the company other than size, so there are many unknowns about the workplaces. 
=======
Overview
This project aims to analyze the relationship between family history of mental health issues, employment status, and the likelihood of seeking mental health treatment. The analysis employs various statistical tests and visualizations to identify patterns and significant factors.
Analysis Summary
Objectives
1.	Primary Hypothesis 1: Self-employed individuals are less likely to seek mental health treatment compared to employed individuals.
2.	Primary Hypothesis 2: Individuals with a family history of mental health issues are more likely to seek mental health treatment compared to those without such a history.
Findings
1.	Employment Status:
o	The analysis shows no substantial difference in mental health treatment-seeking behavior between self-employed and employed individuals.
o	Bar Graph: The number of self-employed individuals seeking treatment is slightly higher than those not seeking treatment. For employed individuals, the numbers are almost equal.

2.	Family History:
o	Individuals with a family history of mental health issues are significantly more likely to seek treatment compared to those without such a history.
o	Bar Graph: Individuals with a family history seeking treatment significantly outnumber those not seeking treatment, and the opposite is true for individuals without a family history.

o	Heat Map: Supports the finding that family history influences treatment-seeking behavior.

o	Violin Plot: Shows a higher density of treatment-seeking behavior among individuals with a family history.

Statistical Analysis
•	T-test:
o	T-statistic: 14.755
o	P-value: 3.919e-45
Conclusion
•	Family history significantly influences the likelihood of seeking mental health treatment, whereas employment status does not appear to be a strong determinant.
•	These insights can guide further research and targeted interventions in mental health services, emphasizing the importance of family history in shaping treatment-seeking behavior.
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the factors influencing mental health treatment-seeking behavior, with a focus on family history and employment status.
